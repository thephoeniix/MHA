# My Hero Academia Program

This project is based on an anime called My Heri Academia, which searches for heroes and sorts them. Then is expected to create missions and send the perfect team based on their strength and weaknesses. 
This repository contains information and characteristics of each character such as name, type (villain, pro-hero, teacher, or student) quirk, power, speed, technique, intelligence, and cooperativeness. 

## Hero Information

- **Name**: Fat-Gum
- **Type**: Pro-Hero
- **Quirk**: Fat Absorption
- **Power**: 5
- **Speed**: 2
- **Technique**: 4
- **Intelligence**: 4
- **Cooperativeness**: 5

## The code 

We read the information from 'heroes.txt'. 

There is a menu where you can:
----1. Get all Heros Information-------
----2. Sort by Speed (better to worst)-

## Merge Sort

For this issue, I employed a merge sort algorithm to arrange heroes' speed in the best worst. I choose merge sort because it is generally fast in most cases. 
*Merge Sort* 
Time Complexity: O(n log(n) 
Space Complexity: O(n)



## Getting Started

You can use this repository to access information about My Hero Academia.


## Resorces

I got the information on a fandom page:
